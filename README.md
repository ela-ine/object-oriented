# object-oriented

This course shows how to model concepts from the physical world within a computer program in a way that makes the boundaries between objects clear. Different languages have different ways of implementing this paradigm, and we'll explore some of the tradeoffs between these choices. The semester's coursework will be computer programming projects that gradually increase in size and complexity.
